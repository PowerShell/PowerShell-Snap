# Use of Trademarked Logos

The assets in this folder are trademarked by Microsoft and don't fall under the same [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/LICENSE.txt) as the source code.

## Permitted Uses

Parties interested in using these logos can review the [Use of Microsoft Copyrighted Material](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/permissions) page.
If the use falls into any of those categories, you can move forward with the use and will not need additional permission.

## Third Party Permission Requests

If questions remain after reviewing the permitted uses page, please submit a request to [Third Party Permissions](mailto:mscrqs@microsoft.com).
The people supporting this will direct the request depending upon the content.

If a request needs to be submitted to the [Third Party Permissions](mailto:mscrqs@microsoft.com), the request should include the following:

  - A statement that the [Use of Microsoft Copyrighted Material](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/permissions) was reviewed and did not address the situation.
  - A statement that Microsoft (and not a third party) is the owner of the logo at issue.
  - Clear identification of the materials to be used (i.e., the picture of the book cover included by the author in the letter request should suffice).
  - A description, including URLs of how they found or located the logo.
  - A description of how the party intends to use or distribute the logo (i.e., that it is for the book cover of an instructional book on PowerShell).
  - A description of how long the party needs to use the logo.
